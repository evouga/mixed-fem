Use d^2 for barrier only, and d for constraint...

<<<<<<< HEAD
- Plot lagrange multiplires for a "failing" timestep. For a couple different examples
  - To eevaluate whether we need augmented lagrangian
- Mixed Friction
- Linear SOlver stuff

- What kind of accuracy do we need for our iterative solver to reach our solution?
- Play around with single linear system in matlab 


- iterations vs newton steps to reach convergence
- Also record total # iterations across entire timestep
